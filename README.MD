# libBezierFiveLines -- WIP

Generate quadratic curve and pool table simulation

using Bezier Curve and slope line equation

```About```

**The window is not resizable**

Origin: (400, 400) 

Middle triangle: The maximum/minimum size of the curve

```Usage```

Use arrow keys (left/right) or mouse (up/down) to change its width and (up/down) to change the accuracy of its height; type "a" to add more lines, "s" to remove lines and "c" to close the window

click near the blue text to add/remove lines (add: 0-50; remove: 50-100)

type "t" or click once to toggle changing height (up/down)

Click "g" or click at the origin to start animate the ball in simulation mode

Uncheck "mousechange" if you want to use the simulation mode where pink line is the reflection path of the ball (Green); otherwise, check it.

```TODO```

+ Check the math

```Compile to jar```

Run Compile.bat @ /makeJar
